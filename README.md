# __Finding Lane Lines on the Road__
This project is my submission/ implementation for an assignment
within udacity's Self Driving Car Nano Degree (SDCND).

The actual report/ writeup can be found [here](Writeup.md).
The notebook, which contains the actual implementation, [is here](P1.ipynb).

## LICENSE
I include the original LICENSE from udacity, since the contents of this
are largely derived from the stuff udacity provided.
For my modifications: use freely as you want, but be aware, that this is just
a study assignment, thus no warranty; there is probably bugs!
